orcheil
=======

orcheil is a web app for the visualization of orchestration. The goal is to provide a clear and immediate representation of when an instrument is or is not performing in a piece of music. This can reveal, for instance, the instrumentation of a composite timbre, or the role of orchestration in articulating form. It is a timbre-first visualization of music.

orcheil is online at [orcheil.ca].

orcheil is built with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/), and ❤️.
